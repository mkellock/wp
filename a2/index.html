          <p>This year is the centenary of the birth of the ANZAC legend. As
            such, many people, particularly young people, are looking for ways
            to connect with people of that period and inparticular, those who
            created the ANZAC legend.</p>
          <p>This site presents the letters of Douglas Raymond Baker, who came
            from Gympie, Queensland, Australia. He enlisted in August 1914 and
            during the years that followed, he wrote letters and post cards to
            his family at home. In them, he describes much of the goings-on of
            the life of an ANZAC, his feeling and opinions, and experiences
            while visiting his relatives in England during leave.</p>
          <p>They start from the beginning of basic training in Brisbane in
            August 1914 and end in May 1918.</p>
          <p>They are offered here so that others may get an understanding of
            life as an ANZAC and get a sense of what life on the battlefield was
            like.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>By Douglas Richard Baker (son of Douglas Raymond Baker)</p>
        <p>These are copies of letters written by my father Douglas Raymond
          Baker during the First World War (1914-1918) to his family in Gympie.
          I have three thick exercise books in which the letters were copied in
          hand writing by my Aunt Alice, his sister. I understand that this was
          done so his letters could be sent on to other members of the family. I
          don’t know if the originals are still in existence, probably not.</p>
        <p>In the early letters Alice has not included the name of the person
          they were written to but later she writes at the beginning, “Letter to
          Dot”, “Letter to Mother”, etc. and later still copies the original,
          “Dear Al”, “Dear Mag”, etc.. Likewise the endings are often not laid
          out fully as we would do but Al may have done this or Dad may have
          been saving space on the page.</p>
        <p>Some letters are slightly out of date order in the books but as most
          of these are around the time his father died I have put them in the
          correct order as this is crucial to understanding the sense of the
          contents. A lot will be missing – many, many ships were sunk but
          thanks to Aunt Alice we have these copies of the ones that did get
          through.</p>
        <p>Where Dad used brackets in a letter I have used [ ] style and where I
          have made any comment or explanation I have used ( ) and Italics.</p>
        <p>Where he uses the word “gay” it is used in the true sense, bright,
          happy, carefree, etc., This is the original meaning of the word before
          it became associated with the homosexual community.</p>
        <p>The amounts of money are, of course, in Pounds, shillings and pence
          but as these are out of date and we have no pounds sign in the
          computer I have written them in, sometimes showing the decimal
          equivalents. One Pound equalled $2, one shilling equalled 10 cents and
          one penny equalled a little under one cent. After a while I stopped
          putting the equivalents in as they had cno significance unless you
          knew the relative cost of things then and now. A shilling – equivalent
          to ten cents might actually alent to ten cents might actually buy buy
          ten or twenty dollars worth of goods now.</p>

        <h2>Additional Comments by Ian Stuart Baker (son of Douglas Richard
          Baker)</h2>
        <p>As the grandson of the Douglas Raymond, I'd like to share some
          thoughts with modern readers. Apart from the language issues that my
          Dad highlights, it would also help to recognise that in Grandfathers
          day, the letter was the only means of international communications for
          average people (telegrams were expensive and used rarely and
          international telephone calls, rarer still). That's why these letters
          are so important and why their content gives us window into their
          lives.</p>
        <p>From discussions with my Dad, it has came to light that the content
          of letters to his direct family deliberately leave out much of the
          dreadful suffering and drudgery experienced by the diggers. This
          intentional self-editing was intended to allay the fears and concerns
          of those at home, inparticular, his mother and sisters.</p>
        <p>Finally, let me express a debt of thanks to Great Aunt Alice for
          diligently transcribing the original letters for without this effort,
          we would not have the material we do today. Also, my gratitude to my
          father for his work transforming the hand-written script into a typed
          paper record and then into electronic format, making my part in this
          infinitely easier.</p>
