          <p>This year is the centenary of the birth of the ANZAC legend. As
            such, many people, particularly young people, are looking for ways
            to connect with people of that period and inparticular, those who
            created the ANZAC legend.</p>
          <p>This site presents the letters of Douglas Raymond Baker, who came
            from Gympie, Queensland, Australia. He enlisted in August 1914 and
            during the years that followed, he wrote letters and post cards to
            his family at home. In them, he describes much of the goings-on of
            the life of an ANZAC, his feeling and opinions, and experiences
            while visiting his relatives in England during leave.</p>
          <p>They start from the beginning of basic training in Brisbane in
            August 1914 and end in May 1918.</p>
          <p>They are offered here so that others may get an understanding of
            life as an ANZAC and get a sense of what life on the battlefield was
            like.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>By Douglas Richard Baker (son of Douglas Raymond Baker)</p>
        <p>These are copies of letters written by my father Douglas Raymond
          Baker during the First World War (1914-1918) to his family in Gympie.
          I have three thick exercise books in which the letters were copied in
          hand writing by my Aunt Alice, his sister. I understand that this was
          done so his letters could be sent on to other members of the family. I
          don&rsquo;t know if the originals are still in existence, probably
          not.</p>
        <p>In the early letters Alice has not included the name of the person
          they were written to but later she writes at the beginning,
          &ldquo;Letter to Dot&rdquo;, &ldquo;Letter to Mother&rdquo;, etc. and
          later still copies the original, &ldquo;Dear Al&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dear
          Mag&rdquo;, etc.. Likewise the endings are often not laid out fully as
          we would do but Al may have done this or Dad may have been saving
          space on the page.</p>
        <p>Some letters are slightly out of date order in the books but as most
          of these are around the time his father died I have put them in the
          correct order as this is crucial to understanding the sense of the
          contents. A lot will be missing &ndash; many, many ships were sunk but
          thanks to Aunt Alice we have these copies of the ones that did get
          through.</p>
        <p>Where Dad used brackets in a letter I have used [ ] style and where I
          have made any comment or explanation I have used ( ) and Italics.</p>
        <p>Where he uses the word &ldquo;gay&rdquo; it is used in the true
          sense, bright, happy, carefree, etc., This is the original meaning of
          the word before it became associated with the homosexual community.</p>
        <p>The amounts of money are, of course, in Pounds, shillings and pence
          but as these are out of date and we have no pounds sign in the
          computer I have written them in, sometimes showing the decimal
          equivalents. One Pound equalled $2, one shilling equalled 10 cents and
          one penny equalled a little under one cent. After a while I stopped
          putting the equivalents in as they had cno significance unless you
          knew the relative cost of things then and now. A shilling &ndash;
          equivalent to ten cents might actually alent to ten cents might
          actually buy buy ten or twenty dollars worth of goods now.</p>

        <h2>Additional Comments by Ian Stuart Baker (son of Douglas Richard
          Baker)</h2>
        <p>As the grandson of the Douglas Raymond, I'd like to share some
          thoughts with modern readers. Apart from the language issues that my
          Dad highlights, it would also help to recognise that in Grandfathers
          day, the letter was the only means of international communications for
          average people (telegrams were expensive and used rarely and
          international telephone calls, rarer still). That's why these letters
          are so important and why their content gives us window into their
          lives.</p>
        <p>From discussions with my Dad, it has came to light that the content
          of letters to his direct family deliberately leave out much of the
          dreadful suffering and drudgery experienced by the diggers. This
          intentional self-editing was intended to allay the fears and concerns
          of those at home, inparticular, his mother and sisters.</p>
        <p>Finally, let me express a debt of thanks to Great Aunt Alice for
          diligently transcribing the original letters for without this effort,
          we would not have the material we do today. Also, my gratitude to my
          father for his work transforming the hand-written script into a typed
          paper record and then into electronic format, making my part in this
          infinitely easier.</p>

        <h1>Fort Tigne Hospital, Malta, May 4th 1915</h1>
        <p class="handwriting rightalign">May 4th. 1915.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Dear Mother,</p>
        <p class="handwriting">About six hundred of Australian wounded
          [including myself] have arrived at the above address and all are in
          good spirits. Of course those who were very severely wounded were
          left
          at Alexandria and there was a great number of them too. But I
          believe
          I am starting at the wrong end, so will go back a little over a week
          when we were on board the &ldquo;Malda&rdquo; in Lemnos Island
          Harbour. I could go back even further than that to the time when we
          left Mena Camp [Feb. 28th] and sailed by the troopship
          &ldquo;Ionian&rdquo; to Lemnos Island, of our five weeks under
          canvas
          there and all our experiences, etc.; but I am afraid it would take
          too
          long and at present there is plenty of later news to write about.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Well, to resume my story &ndash; we were on
          board
          the Troopship &ldquo;Malda&rdquo; on Saturday, April 24th, waiting
          for
          British destroyers to take us to the place where we were to land and
          meet the Turks. At 10 p.m. we had our last meal on the
          &ldquo;Malda&rdquo; and somewhere about midnight, two destroyers
          came
          alongside and we were immediately transhipped to them. Previously to
          this though, the &ldquo;Malda&rdquo; had left Lemnos Harbour with us
          and taken a few hours trip to some place unknown. It was at this
          place
          that the destroyers joined us and our Company went on board the
          &ldquo;Colne&rdquo; and we steamed away from the &ldquo;Malda&rdquo;
          in the direction of the Dardanelles. We were all crowded on the
          deck,
          quite comfortable, and at 3 a.m. hot cocoa was served out to all
          hands. About this time the &ldquo;Colne&rdquo; stopped and it was
          4.30
          a.m. before she moved on again. We had not gone far before land
          could
          be seen ahead and we all then got into small boats which were
          alongside. The order was given to push off and make for land, just
          as
          day was beginning to break. The oarsmen gave way with a will and we
          were still 100 yards from shore when the exciting times commenced.
          There were six boat-loads of us and many others from other
          destroyers
          and cruisers all making for the shore at once.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">The Turks must have been expecting us for their
          bullets began to fly all round the boats. Luckily not one in our
          boat
          was hit but others did not get off so well, for one fellow was
          killed
          and many were wounded. When our boat grounded we jumped out, almost
          up
          to the hips in water and made for the shore. It was my luck to step
          into a hole and I went almost under water, getting my rifle wet, but
          I
          managed to get to land otherwise unhurt. George Thomas was with us
          and
          gave the order to &ldquo;Fix bayonets, open out and advance.&rdquo;
          Ahead of us was a steep hill covered with thick undergrowth from 2
          feet to 5 feet high and forming excellent cover for the enemy and
          also
          ourselves, but not bullet-proof. We got to the top of the first
          hill,
          about 100 feet high, in quick time and without mishap, the Turks
          retreating before us as we advanced. Ahead of us as far as we could
          see the country was all hills and gullies covered with the same
          thick
          undergrowth.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax1"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">It was now broad daylight and as we forged
          onward
          an occasional bullet would whiz past unpledasantly close, but the
          enemy were poor rifle shots, for when we got to the top of the next
          hill only two had been wounded. We all got mixed up as we advanced
          owing to the nature of the country and I lost sight of most of my
          own
          mates. At this point not many of the enemy were opposed to us,
          although we came across many abandoned kit-bags and gear, as if they
          had left in a hurry. But on our left the firing was fairly heavy and
          continuous so the party I was with moved in that direction and we
          were
          soon in the thick of it. By this time many British battleships had
          opened fire on the Turkish forts and also on the enemy artillery,
          their shells flying over our heads and making an awful row. We drove
          the Turks back and captured four guns, many tents and ammunition,
          but
          reinforcements did not come up to us fast enough and we were forced
          to
          retire &ndash; but not for long. The enemy took up a strong position
          behind the top of a hill and there were many thousands of them
          including many German officers. They easily outnumbered us and had
          plenty of artillery and machine guns. All we had to depend on was
          our
          rifle fire and 1 or 2 machine guns so their advantage over us was
          indeed great. The fire of the enemy was absolutely murderous but our
          fellows advanced again and again and were dropping in all directions
          but would not be stopped.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">That Sunday the Australians proved what stuff
          they were made of and many a one made a hero of himself, and many a
          poor fellow died urging his mates onward with his last breath. The
          hail of bullets was simply awful and the shrapnel shells were
          bursting
          round us all the time. They must have expended a marvellous amount
          of
          ammunition. Many of our officers were shot down and most of the time
          we got no orders at all but had to rely on ourselves and do the best
          we could. At any time we did happen to see an officer the order was
          always the same, &ldquo;Get ahead, lads, and stick it into
          them.&rdquo; Another advantage the Turks had over us was a thorough
          knowledge of the country and they had the ranges for their fire. And
          I
          suppose they were fresh too, but we had been up all the night
          before,
          got wet coming ashore and had had no breakfast, although we had food
          in our haversacks but had no time to eat it.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">The Battalions were all mixed up and I saw very
          few of my own Coy.. Once I spotted Monty Woodyatt and gave him a
          call;
          he yelled out to me to come his way and we both forged ahead but got
          seperated almost immediately and I never saw him again. I heard
          later
          that he had been shot dead but do not yet know if it is true.
          Shortly
          after seeing Monty I joined Geo. Thomas and Billy Money behind some
          bush and the bullets were raining around us thick and fast. The
          cries
          of the wounded men about us were deadly and there were no
          stretcher-bearers about. Our position became too hot for us so Bill
          Money and I dashed ahead; I do not know how the bullets managed to
          miss us. We kept going ahead in short rushes and soon were almost
          near
          enough to resume firing again. As usual we were lying down behind
          bushes which formed a good cover but were not bullet proof. We had
          only been in this position a few minutes when I felt a thud in the
          back and afterwards found that a bullet had ripped the side of my
          haversack and tore a hole through a tin of &ldquo;bully-beef&rdquo;
          that I had in it. Our haversacks were strapped to our backs for
          convenience. It was a close shave but everyone was getting used to
          close shaves by then.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax2"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">You know, Mother, it might sound like skite but
          I&rsquo;m satisfied that the old tale that a soldier nearly dies of
          fright when first under fire is all bosh. I heard many of our
          fellows
          say the same thing. It makes you feel a bit uncomfortable but it
          also
          makes you want to get at the enemy and pay it all back with
          interest.
          There was one bad point about our fellows, they were too eager and
          rushed ahead in any sort of order, often exposing themselves
          unneccessarily. Within a minute of getting one in my haversack, I
          heard a groan beside me and saw Bill Money&rsquo;s head drop. We
          were
          lying at full length on our stomachs. He said, &ldquo;Ray, I&rsquo;m
          hit&rdquo; and I, with the aid of another chap who was near turned
          him
          over and got his equipment off. When I opened out his coat and shirt
          there was a bullet hole showing high up on his left breast, it might
          have been in the shoulder blade and very little blood was coming
          from
          it. Poor old Bill was almost unconscious and asked me if it had
          touched his heart. Of course I told him that it had not and that it
          would be alright. We managed to put on his &ldquo;first field
          dressing&rdquo; [one of which we all carry] and gave him a drink of
          water. We made him as comfortable as possible under the
          circumstances
          and I stacked his gear in front of his head so as to stop another
          bullet from hitting him. All the time I was expecting to get lobbed
          myself for the fire of the enemy was simply hellish. So fast and
          thick
          were the bullets coming that some of the time the sound of them was
          for all the world like the buzz of an electric fan &ndash; a
          continual
          hum. We had only just got Bill fixed when another chap on the other
          side of me was shot through the arm. The bullet must have cut an
          artery for when I cut open his sleeve the blood poured out and my
          hands were smothered in blood. We bound his arm as well as we could
          and told him to crawl to the rear. Two other chaps near us stopped
          bullets so I thought it was time to stop attending to wounded men
          for
          it is greatly against military rules for riflemen to stop to attend
          to
          wounds. Everyone unhurt was needed in the firing line, so I had
          another look at Bill Money who seemed quite unconscious and then
          retired a little to see if I could get any stretcher-bearers but
          there
          were none about and they were yelling out for more men so I joined a
          few chaps who were advancing and moved up with them. We went to the
          right of where I had left poor old Bill, so I did not see him again.
          Later in the day one of my Company told me he had seen Bill making
          his
          way towards the beach so I am in hopes that he is getting on
          alright.
          I would give anything to be sure of it.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">As we advanced the fire, if possible, became
          hotter but I seemed to bear a charmed life, one bullet ripped
          through
          my left coat sleeve at the wrist without touching my arm. Shortly
          afterwards, when lying down, my water bottle stopped one and I lost
          all the water, which was a serious loss indeed. But I had a still
          narrower escape when a bullet tore through the collar of my tunic
          right under my chin. The badge must have turned it aside for there
          is
          a dent in it and a little bit of lead sticking to it. My collar was
          turned up a little for the bullet hit from the underneath side. I am
          thinking of cutting it off and sending it home to you for a
          keepsake.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">It was not till about 3 p.m. that I was put out
          of action, when we were giving the Turks some hot fire and, of
          course,
          getting it hot in return. Their shrapnel was very deadly and we
          would
          hear the shells go whizzing over our heads and then go off with a
          bang. These shells contain hundreds of bullets and when they burst
          the
          bullets fly out. It was a shrapnel bullet that got me. A shell burst
          just a few yards to the left of me [I was lying down] and the
          sensation I got was as if someone had hit me with a large club full
          force on the muscle on the left arm. At the same time something hit
          me
          on the right forearm and left a black bruise there. My left arm was
          now useless and the blood was flowing freely so I thought it was
          time
          to retire and accordingly did so, dodging bullets all the time.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax3"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">A few hundred yards back from the firing line I
          met one of our sergeants (what the hell&rsquo;s the Sgt. doing
          there?
          D.B.) who put on my first field dressing. I saw then that a bullet
          had
          gone right through my arm near the shoulder, the hole in each side
          being about half an inch in diameter. I had nearly two miles to go
          to
          the beach &ndash; it was a deadly journey. I expected to get a few
          more gentle reminders from the beastly Turks for stray bullets were
          whistling about all the time. Anyway I got to the beach without
          further harm and now I am none the worse for my experience. It was
          hard luck to be put out of action the first day, but still I had
          about
          ten hours of it - and it was hot stuff,too. Some old soldiers who
          have
          been in action before say they have never seen or heard anything
          like
          it. They say there would be nothing in France to equal it.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">It was a very severe day for the Australians
          and
          we suffered heavily. Colonel Lee [who was shot through the hand] was
          greatly cut up and was heard to exclaim, &ldquo;Oh! My poor Ninth,
          my
          poor Ninth, they will be cut to pieces, they are bearing the brunt
          of
          it all.&rdquo; The scene on the beach in the afternoon was awful
          &ndash; the doctors and ambulance men had their hands full; wounded
          men were lying everywhere. I saw George Thomas and Billy McGowan on
          the beach, both wounded in the shoulder, the former rather badly, I
          think. Even on the beach we were not too safe for the enemy were
          firing on the battleships and their shrapnel was bursting over us
          all
          the time. Unless you happened to be there you would hardly credit
          how
          marvellous were some of the escapes from death and the many
          different
          kinds of wounds showed that after all there are not many parts of
          the
          human body on which bullets prove fatal. One chap was shot right
          through the head, the bullet going in about an inch behind one eye
          and
          coming out an inch behind the other. He is not much the worse for it
          except that he has two lovely black eyes and they are nearly closed
          up, but his sight is not injured. There are many fellows with
          bullets
          still in their heads and they are doing alright. One poor chap was
          struck deaf and dumb by the bursting of a shrapnel shell close over
          his head but was otherwise unhurt. Another fellow who had half his
          face blown off just coolly finished himself off with his own rifle.
          A
          mate of his was with him at the time.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Dear Mother, I suppose you will think I am
          giving
          you too much of the horrors of war, but I thought you all would like
          to know all I could tell you about our first engagement. Here is one
          amusing incident to tone it down a little. A private was lying down
          behind cover near the firing line when someone else dashed up and
          dropped down beside him. The private noticed at once that he had no
          rifle so he roared at him, &ldquo;What are you doing up here without
          a
          rifle you d----- fool.&rdquo; The other fellow [who happened to be
          an
          officer] just calmly replied, &ldquo;Officers don&rsquo;t carry
          rifles, you d----- fool.&rdquo; I suppose the private would feel
          rather small, that is, if he had time to.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax4"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">As quickly as possible the wounded were taken
          off
          in boats &ndash; the very bad cases going to the Hospital ship and
          the
          others to the transport ships that were lying near. About 800
          [including myself] were placed on board the Clan MacGillivary; the
          hospital ship was filled and two or three other troopships, so you
          can
          see there was a great number of wounded, somewhere about 5,000 I
          think. It was near 5 p.m. when we boarded the Clan Mac - and did not
          leave her till this morning. Since then we have, I mean since we
          went
          on board the Clan Mac - up till this morning, we have slept on the
          hard lower deck and lived on biscuits, cheese and jam.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">You know, dear Mother, we first went to
          Alexandria where they found there would not be room for us so only
          the
          worse cases were taken off. The next morning after our arrival
          there,
          the &ldquo;Clan Mac&rdquo; turned tail with us and made for Malta.
          We
          all growled a bit at first at being cooped up on board for a few
          more
          days but now I am glad for the climate here will be miles better
          than
          Egypt. Mr. Thomas was taken off at Alexandria. Capt. Jackson was
          wounded but he was on some other boat. I do not think his was a bad
          case. Nearly all our officers were wounded and I believe 2 or 3 were
          killed.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Wed., May 5th. The Clan Mac dropped anchor in
          Malta harbour early yesterday morning and after breakfast we were
          taken ashore in lighters drawn by steam tugs. We are now quartered
          in
          barracks, 12 men being in each room and we are quite comfortable. I
          am
          on the 3rd Floor and there is a lovely view of the forts and the sea
          on one side and of the city on the other. We have electric light and
          plenty of water laid on and very convenient. The people are very
          kind
          and gave us a warm welcome. We are allowed to stroll about and
          yesterday many of us visited the English school, to the great
          delight
          of the kiddies, who seemed to think we were great heros. They
          pestered
          the life out of us for badges and foreign coins and gave us great
          bunches of lovely flowers. Our room looks quite gay with the flowers
          I
          got. We had quite a gay time with the youngsters and the school
          mistress [who is a bosker girl] could get no work out of them for
          the
          rest of the day.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax5"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">Yesterday afternoon the school kids were going
          round with chocolates and cigarettes and also papers and magazines
          for
          the poor wounded Australians. This room in which I am writing was
          opened to us yesterday and paper, pens and ink supplied free &ndash;
          also soft drinks. The chaplain stationed here is a fine fellow and
          works hard for the entertainment of the soldiers as do also many of
          the ladies.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">And now dear home folk, I hope I have not
          wearied
          you with such a long epistle &ndash; anyway I am just about at the
          end
          of my tether, but will write again soon. I have no idea how long I
          will be here but reckon my arm will be quite well in a fortnight or
          less, so if my luck is in I may be back at the front before you get
          this letter. It is a long time since I had a letter and goodness
          knows
          when we are likely to get another mail. But keep on writing for we
          may
          get them sometime or other. I only hope you are all enjoying the
          best
          of health and continue to do so and that this letter reaches you
          alright. We have been told that these letters will not be censored.
          While at Alexandria I sent you a p.c. written in a hurry.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Well, good-bye dear Mother, with the best of
          love
          to you all. Hope Dad is in good nick, also the girls and Herb. I
          would
          very much like to know if you got the news of the Australians
          fighting
          at Gallipoli and what the papers said about it. I think we did our
          duty.</p>

        <h1>Somewhere in France, July 30th. 1916</h1>
        <p class="handwriting rightalign">May 4th. 1915.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Dear Mother,</p>
        <p class="handwriting"> About six hundred of Australian wounded
          [including myself] have arrived at the above address and all are in
          good spirits. Of course those who were very severely wounded were
          left
          at Alexandria and there was a great number of them too. But I
          believe
          I am starting at the wrong end, so will go back a little over a week
          when we were on board the &ldquo;Malda&rdquo; in Lemnos Island
          Harbour. I could go back even further than that to the time when we
          left Mena Camp [Feb. 28th] and sailed by the troopship
          &ldquo;Ionian&rdquo; to Lemnos Island, of our five weeks under
          canvas
          there and all our experiences, etc.; but I am afraid it would take
          too
          long and at present there is plenty of later news to write about.</p>
        <p class="handwriting"> Well, to resume my story &ndash; we were on
          board the Troopship &ldquo;Malda&rdquo; on Saturday, April 24th,
          waiting for British destroyers to take us to the place where we were
          to land and meet the Turks. At 10 p.m. we had our last meal on the
          &ldquo;Malda&rdquo; and somewhere about midnight, two destroyers
          came
          alongside and we were immediately transhipped to them. Previously to
          this though, the &ldquo;Malda&rdquo; had left Lemnos Harbour with us
          and taken a few hours trip to some place unknown. It was at this
          place
          that the destroyers joined us and our Company went on board the
          &ldquo;Colne&rdquo; and we steamed away from the &ldquo;Malda&rdquo;
          in the direction of the Dardanelles. We were all crowded on the
          deck,
          quite comfortable, and at 3 a.m. hot cocoa was served out to all
          hands. About this time the &ldquo;Colne&rdquo; stopped and it was
          4.30
          a.m. before she moved on again. We had not gone far before land
          could
          be seen ahead and we all then got into small boats which were
          alongside. The order was given to push off and make for land, just
          as
          day was beginning to break. The oarsmen gave way with a will and we
          were still 100 yards from shore when the exciting times commenced.
          There were six boat-loads of us and many others from other
          destroyers
          and cruisers all making for the shore at once.</p>
        <p class="handwriting"> The Turks must have been expecting us for
          their
          bullets began to fly all round the boats. Luckily not one in our
          boat
          was hit but others did not get off so well, for one fellow was
          killed
          and many were wounded. When our boat grounded we jumped out, almost
          up
          to the hips in water and made for the shore. It was my luck to step
          into a hole and I went almost under water, getting my rifle wet, but
          I
          managed to get to land otherwise unhurt. George Thomas was with us
          and
          gave the order to &ldquo;Fix bayonets, open out and advance.&rdquo;
          Ahead of us was a steep hill covered with thick undergrowth from 2
          feet to 5 feet high and forming excellent cover for the enemy and
          also
          ourselves, but not bullet-proof. We got to the top of the first
          hill,
          about 100 feet high, in quick time and without mishap, the Turks
          retreating before us as we advanced. Ahead of us as far as we could
          see the country was all hills and gullies covered with the same
          thick
          undergrowth.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax6"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">It was now broad daylight and as we forged
          onward
          an occasional bullet would whiz past unpledasantly close, but the
          enemy were poor rifle shots, for when we got to the top of the next
          hill only two had been wounded. We all got mixed up as we advanced
          owing to the nature of the country and I lost sight of most of my
          own
          mates. At this point not many of the enemy were opposed to us,
          although we came across many abandoned kit-bags and gear, as if they
          had left in a hurry. But on our left the firing was fairly heavy and
          continuous so the party I was with moved in that direction and we
          were
          soon in the thick of it. By this time many British battleships had
          opened fire on the Turkish forts and also on the enemy artillery,
          their shells flying over our heads and making an awful row. We drove
          the Turks back and captured four guns, many tents and ammunition,
          but
          reinforcements did not come up to us fast enough and we were forced
          to
          retire &ndash; but not for long. The enemy took up a strong position
          behind the top of a hill and there were many thousands of them
          including many German officers. They easily outnumbered us and had
          plenty of artillery and machine guns. All we had to depend on was
          our
          rifle fire and 1 or 2 machine guns so their advantage over us was
          indeed great. The fire of the enemy was absolutely murderous but our
          fellows advanced again and again and were dropping in all directions
          but would not be stopped.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">That Sunday the Australians proved what stuff
          they were made of and many a one made a hero of himself, and many a
          poor fellow died urging his mates onward with his last breath. The
          hail of bullets was simply awful and the shrapnel shells were
          bursting
          round us all the time. They must have expended a marvellous amount
          of
          ammunition. Many of our officers were shot down and most of the time
          we got no orders at all but had to rely on ourselves and do the best
          we could. At any time we did happen to see an officer the order was
          always the same, &ldquo;Get ahead, lads, and stick it into
          them.&rdquo; Another advantage the Turks had over us was a thorough
          knowledge of the country and they had the ranges for their fire. And
          I
          suppose they were fresh too, but we had been up all the night
          before,
          got wet coming ashore and had had no breakfast, although we had food
          in our haversacks but had no time to eat it.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">The Battalions were all mixed up and I saw very
          few of my own Coy.. Once I spotted Monty Woodyatt and gave him a
          call;
          he yelled out to me to come his way and we both forged ahead but got
          seperated almost immediately and I never saw him again. I heard
          later
          that he had been shot dead but do not yet know if it is true.
          Shortly
          after seeing Monty I joined Geo. Thomas and Billy Money behind some
          bush and the bullets were raining around us thick and fast. The
          cries
          of the wounded men about us were deadly and there were no
          stretcher-bearers about. Our position became too hot for us so Bill
          Money and I dashed ahead; I do not know how the bullets managed to
          miss us. We kept going ahead in short rushes and soon were almost
          near
          enough to resume firing again. As usual we were lying down behind
          bushes which formed a good cover but were not bullet proof. We had
          only been in this position a few minutes when I felt a thud in the
          back and afterwards found that a bullet had ripped the side of my
          haversack and tore a hole through a tin of &ldquo;bully-beef&rdquo;
          that I had in it. Our haversacks were strapped to our backs for
          convenience. It was a close shave but everyone was getting used to
          close shaves by then.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax7"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">You know, Mother, it might sound like skite but
          I&rsquo;m satisfied that the old tale that a soldier nearly dies of
          fright when first under fire is all bosh. I heard many of our
          fellows
          say the same thing. It makes you feel a bit uncomfortable but it
          also
          makes you want to get at the enemy and pay it all back with
          interest.
          There was one bad point about our fellows, they were too eager and
          rushed ahead in any sort of order, often exposing themselves
          unneccessarily. Within a minute of getting one in my haversack, I
          heard a groan beside me and saw Bill Money&rsquo;s head drop. We
          were
          lying at full length on our stomachs. He said, &ldquo;Ray, I&rsquo;m
          hit&rdquo; and I, with the aid of another chap who was near turned
          him
          over and got his equipment off. When I opened out his coat and shirt
          there was a bullet hole showing high up on his left breast, it might
          have been in the shoulder blade and very little blood was coming
          from
          it. Poor old Bill was almost unconscious and asked me if it had
          touched his heart. Of course I told him that it had not and that it
          would be alright. We managed to put on his &ldquo;first field
          dressing&rdquo; [one of which we all carry] and gave him a drink of
          water. We made him as comfortable as possible under the
          circumstances
          and I stacked his gear in front of his head so as to stop another
          bullet from hitting him. All the time I was expecting to get lobbed
          myself for the fire of the enemy was simply hellish. So fast and
          thick
          were the bullets coming that some of the time the sound of them was
          for all the world like the buzz of an electric fan &ndash; a
          continual
          hum. We had only just got Bill fixed when another chap on the other
          side of me was shot through the arm. The bullet must have cut an
          artery for when I cut open his sleeve the blood poured out and my
          hands were smothered in blood. We bound his arm as well as we could
          and told him to crawl to the rear. Two other chaps near us stopped
          bullets so I thought it was time to stop attending to wounded men
          for
          it is greatly against military rules for riflemen to stop to attend
          to
          wounds. Everyone unhurt was needed in the firing line, so I had
          another look at Bill Money who seemed quite unconscious and then
          retired a little to see if I could get any stretcher-bearers but
          there
          were none about and they were yelling out for more men so I joined a
          few chaps who were advancing and moved up with them. We went to the
          right of where I had left poor old Bill, so I did not see him again.
          Later in the day one of my Company told me he had seen Bill making
          his
          way towards the beach so I am in hopes that he is getting on
          alright.
          I would give anything to be sure of it.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">As we advanced the fire, if possible, became
          hotter but I seemed to bear a charmed life, one bullet ripped
          through
          my left coat sleeve at the wrist without touching my arm. Shortly
          afterwards, when lying down, my water bottle stopped one and I lost
          all the water, which was a serious loss indeed. But I had a still
          narrower escape when a bullet tore through the collar of my tunic
          right under my chin. The badge must have turned it aside for there
          is
          a dent in it and a little bit of lead sticking to it. My collar was
          turned up a little for the bullet hit from the underneath side. I am
          thinking of cutting it off and sending it home to you for a
          keepsake.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">It was not till about 3 p.m. that I was put out
          of action, when we were giving the Turks some hot fire and, of
          course,
          getting it hot in return. Their shrapnel was very deadly and we
          would
          hear the shells go whizzing over our heads and then go off with a
          bang. These shells contain hundreds of bullets and when they burst
          the
          bullets fly out. It was a shrapnel bullet that got me. A shell burst
          just a few yards to the left of me [I was lying down] and the
          sensation I got was as if someone had hit me with a large club full
          force on the muscle on the left arm. At the same time something hit
          me
          on the right forearm and left a black bruise there. My left arm was
          now useless and the blood was flowing freely so I thought it was
          time
          to retire and accordingly did so, dodging bullets all the time.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax8"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">A few hundred yards back from the firing line I
          met one of our sergeants (what the hell&rsquo;s the Sgt. doing
          there?
          D.B.) who put on my first field dressing. I saw then that a bullet
          had
          gone right through my arm near the shoulder, the hole in each side
          being about half an inch in diameter. I had nearly two miles to go
          to
          the beach &ndash; it was a deadly journey. I expected to get a few
          more gentle reminders from the beastly Turks for stray bullets were
          whistling about all the time. Anyway I got to the beach without
          further harm and now I am none the worse for my experience. It was
          hard luck to be put out of action the first day, but still I had
          about
          ten hours of it - and it was hot stuff,too. Some old soldiers who
          have
          been in action before say they have never seen or heard anything
          like
          it. They say there would be nothing in France to equal it.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">It was a very severe day for the Australians
          and
          we suffered heavily. Colonel Lee [who was shot through the hand] was
          greatly cut up and was heard to exclaim, &ldquo;Oh! My poor Ninth,
          my
          poor Ninth, they will be cut to pieces, they are bearing the brunt
          of
          it all.&rdquo; The scene on the beach in the afternoon was awful
          &ndash; the doctors and ambulance men had their hands full; wounded
          men were lying everywhere. I saw George Thomas and Billy McGowan on
          the beach, both wounded in the shoulder, the former rather badly, I
          think. Even on the beach we were not too safe for the enemy were
          firing on the battleships and their shrapnel was bursting over us
          all
          the time. Unless you happened to be there you would hardly credit
          how
          marvellous were some of the escapes from death and the many
          different
          kinds of wounds showed that after all there are not many parts of
          the
          human body on which bullets prove fatal. One chap was shot right
          through the head, the bullet going in about an inch behind one eye
          and
          coming out an inch behind the other. He is not much the worse for it
          except that he has two lovely black eyes and they are nearly closed
          up, but his sight is not injured. There are many fellows with
          bullets
          still in their heads and they are doing alright. One poor chap was
          struck deaf and dumb by the bursting of a shrapnel shell close over
          his head but was otherwise unhurt. Another fellow who had half his
          face blown off just coolly finished himself off with his own rifle.
          A
          mate of his was with him at the time.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Dear Mother, I suppose you will think I am
          giving
          you too much of the horrors of war, but I thought you all would like
          to know all I could tell you about our first engagement. Here is one
          amusing incident to tone it down a little. A private was lying down
          behind cover near the firing line when someone else dashed up and
          dropped down beside him. The private noticed at once that he had no
          rifle so he roared at him, &ldquo;What are you doing up here without
          a
          rifle you d----- fool.&rdquo; The other fellow [who happened to be
          an
          officer] just calmly replied, &ldquo;Officers don&rsquo;t carry
          rifles, you d----- fool.&rdquo; I suppose the private would feel
          rather small, that is, if he had time to.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax9"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">As quickly as possible the wounded were taken
          off
          in boats &ndash; the very bad cases going to the Hospital ship and
          the
          others to the transport ships that were lying near. About 800
          [including myself] were placed on board the Clan MacGillivary; the
          hospital ship was filled and two or three other troopships, so you
          can
          see there was a great number of wounded, somewhere about 5,000 I
          think. It was near 5 p.m. when we boarded the Clan Mac - and did not
          leave her till this morning. Since then we have, I mean since we
          went
          on board the Clan Mac - up till this morning, we have slept on the
          hard lower deck and lived on biscuits, cheese and jam.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">You know, dear Mother, we first went to
          Alexandria where they found there would not be room for us so only
          the
          worse cases were taken off. The next morning after our arrival
          there,
          the &ldquo;Clan Mac&rdquo; turned tail with us and made for Malta.
          We
          all growled a bit at first at being cooped up on board for a few
          more
          days but now I am glad for the climate here will be miles better
          than
          Egypt. Mr. Thomas was taken off at Alexandria. Capt. Jackson was
          wounded but he was on some other boat. I do not think his was a bad
          case. Nearly all our officers were wounded and I believe 2 or 3 were
          killed.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Wed., May 5th. The Clan Mac dropped anchor in
          Malta harbour early yesterday morning and after breakfast we were
          taken ashore in lighters drawn by steam tugs. We are now quartered
          in
          barracks, 12 men being in each room and we are quite comfortable. I
          am
          on the 3rd Floor and there is a lovely view of the forts and the sea
          on one side and of the city on the other. We have electric light and
          plenty of water laid on and very convenient. The people are very
          kind
          and gave us a warm welcome. We are allowed to stroll about and
          yesterday many of us visited the English school, to the great
          delight
          of the kiddies, who seemed to think we were great heros. They
          pestered
          the life out of us for badges and foreign coins and gave us great
          bunches of lovely flowers. Our room looks quite gay with the flowers
          I
          got. We had quite a gay time with the youngsters and the school
          mistress [who is a bosker girl] could get no work out of them for
          the
          rest of the day.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax10"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">Yesterday afternoon the school kids were going
          round with chocolates and cigarettes and also papers and magazines
          for
          the poor wounded Australians. This room in which I am writing was
          opened to us yesterday and paper, pens and ink supplied free &ndash;
          also soft drinks. The chaplain stationed here is a fine fellow and
          works hard for the entertainment of the soldiers as do also many of
          the ladies.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">And now dear home folk, I hope I have not
          wearied
          you with such a long epistle &ndash; anyway I am just about at the
          end
          of my tether, but will write again soon. I have no idea how long I
          will be here but reckon my arm will be quite well in a fortnight or
          less, so if my luck is in I may be back at the front before you get
          this letter. It is a long time since I had a letter and goodness
          knows
          when we are likely to get another mail. But keep on writing for we
          may
          get them sometime or other. I only hope you are all enjoying the
          best
          of health and continue to do so and that this letter reaches you
          alright. We have been told that these letters will not be censored.
          While at Alexandria I sent you a p.c. written in a hurry.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Well, good-bye dear Mother, with the best of
          love
          to you all. Hope Dad is in good nick, also the girls and Herb. I
          would
          very much like to know if you got the news of the Australians
          fighting
          at Gallipoli and what the papers said about it. I think we did our
          duty.</p>

        <h1>Somewhere in France, 13th Aug. 1916</h1>
        <p class="handwriting rightalign">13th August 1916.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Dear Herb,</p>
        <p class="handwriting"> It is the Sabbath day and for a wonder we are
          having a rest so I have time to write a few lines while reclining in
          my billet which at some remote period was a fowl-house. But we are
          accustomed to all sorts of conditions now and learn to make the best
          of things however severe they may be. For some time now we have been
          on the move from one village to another, rarely stopping at one
          place
          for more than a few days. We see a great deal of the country but
          would
          enjoy it more if we had less to carry. Of course you will have read
          much about the Australians being in the &ldquo;Big Push&rdquo; but
          the
          papers could not convey any idea of the real truth of such hellish
          fighting as we were in at Pozieres. I have written to Mother three
          times since I came out and hope the letters arrived alright, giving
          her some sort of an account of things. Our fellows have fought
          marvellously well, gaining all their objectives but at a great cost
          and the casualty lists, if published in the Australian papers will
          be
          a great blow to the people. Our Division [the 1st] which was the
          first
          of the Australians to take part in the push had about 9,000
          casualities and the 2nd Division suffered just as much. For the few
          days we were in it, it was hell on earth, practically no sleep,
          little
          to eat and shells of all sorts and all sizes being pelted at us day
          and night. Dead and wounded lay on all sides and there was blood
          everywhere, in one part of the trench where there had been hand to
          hand fighting, we noticed among the dead an Australian, his hands
          gripping a German by the throat while the latter had his arms around
          the other&rsquo;s body &ndash; both were dead, had been killed by a
          bomb while struggling together. The many sights we saw would make
          your
          blood curdle, they were too awful for me to describe, but there were
          many heroic incidents which made me feel glad that I am British. Our
          bombers for instance did great work. On the second morning of our
          stunt the Huns were holding a bit of trench that we wanted and they
          were very hard to shift, so the officer of the bombers spoke to his
          men, &ldquo;Will we shift them, lads?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Right ho,
          sir&rdquo; was the answer and they hopped out over the parapet, 20
          or
          30 of them, in the face of shells and machine gun fire, raced across
          to the enemy trench and standing there in broad daylight they pelted
          their bombs with great coolness. It was a great bit of work and we
          kept up machine gun fire over their heads during the scrap. The
          trench
          was won, most of the occupants being killed, and of course, our
          chaps
          suffered too. This is only one little incident, the stretcher
          bearers
          toiled and sweated for all they were worth under very severe
          conditions. Our Coy had sixteen guns in action and the only one we
          lost was the one I was on &ndash; the Hun&rsquo;s artillery had the
          range to a T and lobbed over gas shells, tear shells, high
          explosives,
          shrapnel, etc. from 18 pounders to 9.2 inch. It was &ldquo;No
          Bon&rdquo;. Our team consisted of 5 men and 1 officer. The officer
          and
          1 man were wounded and 2 men killed. It was hard luck but such
          things
          are to be expected.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Well anyway, dear Herb, all that is over now
          and
          we are satisfied that things can be no worse. The 4th Division are
          now
          in and we may relieve them soon. At present we are at the village of
          Bonneville waiting for orders, having a quiet time so &ndash;
          what&rsquo;s the use of worrying as long as we are in good health..
          I
          hope all at home are in the best of health also, yourself and the
          girls. I have written to Mrs. McCathie, you will hear the news from
          her not included here. I will also be writing home again soon. Fancy
          you saying &ndash; &ldquo;Vouley-vous promenade,
          mademoiselle.&rdquo;
          She might reply, &ldquo;Oui monsier, merci.&rdquo; Tres Bon, eh? I
          hope Will Raymond and family are well, give them my love and also
          remember me to any other friends. Could you let me know if home
          affairs are settled up yet and how Mother is and the girls. I am
          afraid many letters have miscarried.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Well, hooray old chap, love to all from,</p>

        <h1>No. 2 Can. Gen. Hospital, France. Nov. 1st. ’17</h1>
        <p class="handwriting rightalign">1st November 1917</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Dear May,</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Does it surprise you to receive a letter from
          your humble servant and would you like to know why I have at last
          roused myself and found sufficient energy? Well it is because of a
          few
          pressed violets and a nice message, also Mother&rsquo;s account of
          her
          stay at Sylvan Rd. while in Brisbane. It has served to remind me of
          my
          last few days in Brisbane in 1914 when the dear old Dad was there
          and
          I visited your people &ndash; my cousins. Little did I think then
          that
          three years would pass and still no immediate hopes are there of
          returning.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">As I lie here I have much time for reflection
          and
          the experiences of the past rise vividly before me and I live again
          through those joys and sorrows, good times and hard times. And on
          thinking it over I come to the conclusion that on the whole I have
          been very lucky &ndash; for I still survive while so many of my pals
          have gone West and since coming to France in April 1916 I have been
          in
          all engagements the 1st Division has taken part in. Now I guess I am
          going to miss a few and I am not sorry, for having got over the
          worst
          effects of this wound I feel quite comfortable.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">The day I was wounded, Oct. 4th, we had
          advanced
          with six guns after the first assault of the infantry and were
          making
          positions in an old cemetery. Everywhere the ground had been churned
          up by the shells and only one huge cross of rough timber remained,
          the
          rest lay smashed and broken. At intervals about us were those
          battered
          &ldquo;Pill-boxes&rdquo; which had formed the Huns new system of
          defence. The attack had been entirely successful and hundreds upon
          hundreds of prisoners were hurrying back to the rear without escort
          and glad enough that their fighting days were over. Many of them
          were
          wounded and were being assisted by their comrades and some were
          carrying our wounded on stretchers. The enemy artillery were
          shelling
          us all the time and many of their own men were struck down which was
          hard luck for them. We were in a very exposed position but could not
          take cover for our guns had to be got into action, so the men were
          digging away for all they were worth, taking as little notice as
          possible of the bursting shells. Within a quarter of an hour four of
          my men had been wounded and were taken back &ndash; I say &ldquo;my
          men&rdquo;, May, because I happened to be the Sergeant in charge and
          was supervising the mounting of the guns, the officer had retired to
          one of the &ldquo;pill-boxes&rdquo; [those solid concrete
          blockhouses
          of the Huns]. About an hour before this I had received a slight
          wound
          in the shoulder, hardly severe enough to allow me to retire, but
          made
          my arm stiff and prevented me from working. About the worst thing to
          stand in war is being subjected to shell-fire while not being to do
          anything in return. There we were just waiting to be shot down, it
          was
          only a matter of time, one after another was going and each man
          wondered as he worked when his turn would come.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax11"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">My turn came as I was standing near the cross
          watching a couple of the lads working &ndash; there was a loud crash
          of a bursting shell just behind me, I felt a thud in the back and my
          knees gave way, I tried to speak but only a whisper came, my lung
          had
          been pierced and I could feel the blood flowing inside. With help I
          managed to struggle to the nearest Pill-box where a First-Aid party
          were stationed. I was placed on a stretcher after the wound was
          bandaged and then began the worst journey I have ever experienced in
          my life &ndash; over miles of torn and broken ground , shell holes,
          mud and water. I just longed for someone to knock me right out.
          After
          an hour or so I began to lose consciousness and only have a dim
          recollection of things. I know I was placed in an open truck on a
          small railway alongside some wounded Germans and that rain started
          to
          fall &ndash; I was lying on my face all the time. Next I remembered
          my
          wet clothes being cut off me and then &ndash; I awoke next morning
          in
          a nice clean bed with a nurse bending over me.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">For a few days I did not care much what
          happened,
          then my breathing began to get easier and I did not cough up so much
          blood and since then I have been improving daily. But the metal is
          still somewhere inside and I do not know what the doctor intends to
          do, probably he will operate. There, dear May, you have the whole
          ghastly business of my recent downfall. - It is now nineteen months
          since our Division landed in France and we have taken part in the
          fighting on many parts of the front in northern France and Belgium.
          We
          have had great opportunities of seeing the country, seldom stopping
          in
          one place for long, but marching day after day, sometimes for weeks
          at
          a time from village to village &ndash; coming in contact with all
          manner of people, seeing in the summertime miles and miles of
          beautiful country and acres upon acres of growing crops, well
          trimmed
          hedges of blackberry, hawthorn, etc., grasslands smothered with
          wildflowers, buttercups, daisies and other coloured flowers in wild
          profusion. We have gazed from the summits of many a great hill at
          the
          surrounding expanse of peaceful countryside and it has been good to
          look at.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax12"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">At times we have travelled by train [generally
          in
          horse boxes] from one part of the front to another and it has been
          interesting to watch the ever-changing scenery &ndash; wild and
          rugged
          sometimes and at others low-lying farming districts stretching far
          into the distance. No fences are to be seen and nothing to tell
          where
          one farm ends and another begins. We have stopped in villages, towns
          and cities, slept in all kinds of places, barns generally but also
          in
          stables, fowl houses, warehouses, estaminets and chateaux, in tents
          and in the open with the sky for a roof. In all sorts of weather,
          too,
          we have managed to jog along in full marching order from sweltering
          heat to extreme cold and snow a foot deep &ndash; under a blazing
          sun
          and heavy downfalls of rain and through mud and slush up to our
          knees.
          It has indeed been a great experience and a varied one, yet we are
          generally very happy and none the worse for it all.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">There are times, you know, dear May, when we
          rest
          for a week or two in some quiet spot after being in action. The
          officers are easy on us then, late rising in the morning, no
          parades,
          a good canteen, football, cricket, etc., and leave to neighbouring
          villages or the nearest big town, concerts and pictures at night and
          now and again a big day of Brigade or Divisional Sports. The latter
          will generally start with an &ldquo;Inspection and March Past&rdquo;
          &ndash; General Birdwood, Walker, Plumer or some other big
          &ldquo;Brass Hat&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Will I tell you about the hard times or should
          I
          leave all that out? Just to give you an idea of things I will try
          and
          tell you of our doings during the week before I was wounded which is
          generally the way of things before going into the line. We were at
          the
          town of Steenvoide when orders came to move and those at the head of
          affairs, being in good humour, supplied motor-buses for the troops
          but
          we had to march about 3 miles to the starting point where the whole
          Brigade was lined up on the roadside. The ride was quite enjoyable,
          lasting two or three hours, we started in France, crossed the border
          and finished up in Belgium near the village of Dickiebush. It was
          getting dark then and we marched on another four miles, feeling
          quite
          tired when we reached our destination which was an open grass
          paddock
          containing many shell holes full of water. No one seemed to know
          what
          to do, as per usual, so we sat down and waited, getting cold,
          feeling
          hungry and, sad to relate, growling and swearing. After a while a
          fatigue party was called up to draw canvas shelters from some place
          a
          few hundred yards away, then we got busy and rigged our sleeping
          quarters. It was quite a job, being pitch dark and in a strange
          place.
          Later on we had tea and by ten o&rsquo;clock wre able to retire for
          the night after mounting a gas guard. The following morning after
          breakfast things had to be made ship-shape, sandbags were procured
          and
          suitable dug-outs made, our guns and gear were overhauled and belts
          filled. (The ammunition belts for the Vickers Machine Gun were
          re-usable and had to be refilled with .303 cartridges.) That night a
          sergeant from each section [myself from No. 1] was told off to go up
          to the line to look at the positions we were to take over. Not
          knowing
          the way we were told to wait at &ldquo;Hell-fire Corner&rdquo; for
          an
          officer who would accompany us. We started out at 7.30 p.m., passed
          through the ruined city of Ypres and three miles the other side came
          to Hell-fire Corner. But we did not wait there for that beastly
          corner
          deserves its name, so we retired a few hundred yards. While we
          waited
          five horses and two men were killed and two men wounded at the
          corner
          by shells. The road was thick with traffic all the time, mostly
          horse
          transport with ammunition. Fritz was shelling all the time and blew
          up
          two ammunition dumps on the roadside. I can tell you we were glad
          when
          the officer came along and we were able to proceed. The walk was a
          long one and rough, the sides of the track were lined with dead
          horses
          and mules in various stages of decay, broken waggons and guns and
          debris of all kinds and a few dead men too. Eventually we reached
          the
          positions and learned details of things in general and then began
          the
          trip back to camp about eight miles. Fancy a sixteen mile tramp, we
          got to bed about 3 a.m. properly tired out but thankful enough to
          have
          got through safely.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax13"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">Well the next night I was politely informed
          that
          my services were required again, to guide a working party up to the
          line to improve the positions. I did not feel like going but of
          course
          someone had to and it was no use growling. They were kind enough to
          provide motor vans for us as far as Hell-Fire Corner and we walked
          the
          remainder of the way carrying sand-bags and shovels. Reaching the
          position without mishap we set to work and finished about 3 a.m.
          having had to stop twice and take cover from the heavy shelling.
          Fritz
          was shelling the back area with gas-shells, that invisible stuff
          that
          can only be identified by the taste like mustard in the mouth and a
          slight stinging in the nostrils. Of course we were not thinking of
          gas
          when on the way home but everyone was wearing their gas helmet in
          what
          is called the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; position, ready to adjust in a few
          seconds, this is enforced within a certain distance of the line.
          Suddenly we walked into this gas and very soon took a tumble to what
          it was and had our masks on in quick time. We kept on going to get
          through it and were able to take off our respirators after about 5
          minutes, the little we swallowed did not hurt us. Nothing further
          occurred to disturb us except a few shells coming closer than they
          had
          a right to and we lobbed home just as day was breaking, tired, weary
          and worn, but no casualties. Last night others had a trip up but I
          had
          a good nights rest and was glad of it. Then the following night,
          Oct.
          3rd., the night preceeding the attack, we all went up with our guns
          and gear, getting into position about 3 a.m. on the 4th.. Zero time
          [the time arranged for the opening of the artillery barrage] was
          seven
          minutes to six and we waited anxiously for that time to come for we
          were to work in co-operation with the artillery. The night was
          fairly
          quiet, Fritz was doing most of the shelling, only a few of our big
          guns replying.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Then, dear May, the time arrived and suddenly
          there was one awful roar as hundreds of guns opened up, from
          eighteen
          pounders to twelve inch, the noise was terrific and the sight was
          wonderful to behold, those continuous quivering flashes of light and
          the sound of shells rushing through the air overhead, the swish of
          the
          small ones and the large ones like railway trains tearing along. And
          in the midst of it all could be heard the sharp rattle of our
          machine
          guns, fifteen yards apart over the whole front &ndash; it was indeed
          some barrage. This was kept up for a couple of hours but lifting at
          intervals as the infantry advanced and took their objectives. And
          now
          we are up to the point where our section of guns advanced to the old
          cemetery.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">I wonder, dear May, if you have grown tired of
          all this rigmarole or has it proved a little interesting, I hope the
          latter is the case though perhaps I have not made myself quite
          clear.
          If you have time try and write a few lines for I would like to know
          how you all are. Jack I guess will be quite a big chap now and you
          also will have grown out of all recognition. Give my love to your
          Mother and Father, congratulations to Captain Raymond though rather
          late, may it soon be Major.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Love to yourself and Jack, dear May,</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Your affect. cousin,</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Ray.</p>

        <p class="handwriting rightalign">Harrowby Camp School, Grantham.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Dear Mother,</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Some days ago I wrote the preceeding pages to
          you
          and have not had a chance to resume. We are kept going at this
          school
          all day and at night have two hours writing to do in the lecture
          hall.
          I am keeping very well but quite fed up with this sort of work and
          will be glad when it is over. There are not many Australians here,
          it
          is a school for Tommies mostly with English officers at the head.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">We Australians are always being chipped about
          lax
          discipline, fooling, inattentiveness, strolling about with our hands
          in our pockets, failing to salute and numerous other petty things,
          but
          it makes little difference to our fellows, we take it all in with
          easy
          tolerance and in class work beat the Tommy every time. They will
          soon
          take a full tumble and leave us alone.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">By your letters I can see that many of mine
          have
          gone astray including a very long one I wrote after the Bullecourt
          stunt last May telling you of that great fight of the 5th and 6th of
          May when we were in deadly danger of being wiped out or taken
          prisoner
          &ndash; it was for that stunt that I was awarded the Military Medal.
          There was some good killing of Prussian Guards that morning of May
          6th. I was firing my machine gun at them at a range of 40 yds.
          &ndash;
          did I miss? No!</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax13"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">My gun was knocked out and my team of men
          lessened by three. I took charge of another gun which was short
          handed
          and carried on the good work but Fritz had the range - the gun was
          rendered useless though not much knocked about and a few more men
          went
          West. At this point we had to retire slightly into a side trench
          &ndash; the Sgt. was wounded so I took the only remaining gun and
          here
          we made what we reckoned would be our last stand. We were hemmed in
          on
          three sides, the Huns were getting closer, coming in hundreds, our
          force numbered about 30 altogether &ndash; oh but they did fight; it
          thrills me even now to think of that glorious fight. We knew the
          German dead outnumbered ours. The shells from both sides were
          ripping
          and tearing around us, I had no tripod for my gun but just balanced
          it
          on the top of the parapet, firing all the time whenever I could see
          those grim grey figures with the basin-like steel hats on their
          heads.
          We knew it had to be a fight to a finish &ndash; win or die and we
          won
          and just as things turned in our favour I dropped from the parapet
          with a wound in my arm [right muscle], no longer being able to fire
          a
          gun.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">Reinforcements came up and our original
          positions
          were reoccupied &ndash; very few Huns got back to tell the tale. I
          will not go into details of the awful slaughter and the sickening
          scenes of that deadly struggle &ndash; it was the hardest fighting I
          have yet been in. I managed to get out alright and at night was in
          Hospital at Etaples near the coast.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">It was amusing to read of your experiences with
          Joe on the shopping expedition, he is just the same old stick
          &ndash;
          but very good at heart always, isn&rsquo;t he. Give him my love when
          you write and best wishes to all the family. I can see that Doris
          has
          not changed much, she is indeed a &ldquo;brat&rdquo; (I think this
          was
          Dad&rsquo;s pet name for her, his youngest sister &ndash; maybe all
          the family used it) and must be good company for you all when at
          home.
          I had some fine evenings with Edwin when at the O.T.B. but some-how
          I
          have lost the run of him altogether now. A few days before I left
          the
          O.T.B. I called to see him but the room he had occupied was locked
          up
          and since then I have heard nothing of him &ndash; he may have gone
          to
          France &ndash; but anyhow Doris will know for he was always writing
          to
          her. Geo. J. is in France again, I had a letter from him the other
          day
          written in an old German Pill-Box (usually a round concrete
          fortification with horizontal slits to allow the inmates to fire at
          the enemy with being too exposed themselves) &ndash; he was well and
          happy.</p>
        <div class="parallax parallax14"></div>
        <p class="handwriting">I would like to see Ivy in my old uniform
          &ndash;
          she ought to parade at the drill &ndash; shed and try to enlist, how
          is Friz, I suppose he is in England somewhere, perhaps I will run
          across him yet. All the girls seem to be busy at one thing or
          another
          &ndash; it is great to hear of their doings, brings home nearer to
          me
          and makes me wish I was with you all again. Getting on for four
          years
          now and still no sign of the end. Australia will be quite strange to
          me when I return and all friends too. I often think of Olga and Herb
          and hope by now they are settled down in a nice home of their own
          &ndash; my love to them and the best wishes in the world for their
          future happiness. I wonder if Al is still with you or has she
          succeeded in obtaining a new place. I know dear Mum you would miss
          her
          but I reckon she should try something better and not come down a
          penny
          below 3 Pounds &amp; 10 Shillings. Mag ought to go a bit steady, I
          guess she does the work of about three men, cutting hedge, rearing
          poultry, etc. etc.. I wonder if she would like to cut my crib
          (usually
          lunch to take to work) &ndash; sounds funny does it not? I
          don&rsquo;t
          think I would ever growl about it again, I have been through rather
          too much that I won&rsquo;t forget, but still Mother dear I seem
          none
          the worse, just jogging along as per usual &ndash; in good health.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">I will not be able to write much the next few
          weeks while at this school but will keep you posted even if only a
          P.C.. Tell Dot I will answer her bonsor letter later, in the
          meantime
          she may carry on with the &ldquo;garden beautiful&rdquo; and keep
          well. That is about all, I must go now and do my duty as a soldier
          and
          a man. Do not worry. I am safe in England. Do not work too hard,
          please. Love to all friends. Best of love to you dear Mum and all at
          home. Hooray.</p>
        <p class="handwriting">(There is no signature, I don&rsquo;t know if
          Dad
          finished the letter like that or if Alice left it off by mistake.)</p>
